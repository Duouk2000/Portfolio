# Portfolio

## Description

The aim of this project is to set up a Portfolio page that showcases my work and is viewable on both desktop and mobile devices.

The website can be viewed [here](https://duouk2000.github.io/Portfolio/)

## Installation

NA

## Usage

The website first contains my name and avatar image. Links to other parts of the webpage and CV are also at the top of the page. I have added an about section and created a Flex Grid showcasing my projects. Click on the image titled "Code Refracturing" to be taken to that website. Future projects will be aded to this website as I create them.

Links for contacting me via email and for accessing my GitHub and LinkedIn are at the bottom of the page.
